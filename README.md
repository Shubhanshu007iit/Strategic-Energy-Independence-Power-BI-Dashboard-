# Strategic-Energy-Independence-Power-BI-Dashboard-
A Power BI-driven analytical dashboard that visualizes India’s journey toward strategic energy independence. This repository contains datasets, PBIX files, documentation, and insights related to energy production, import dependency, renewable growth, defense-sector energy usage, and policy impact evaluation.


🇮🇳 Strategic Energy Independence – Indian Defence Sector Dashboard ReportThis report summarizes the key data points and insights presented in the Strategic Energy Independence dashboard for the Indian Defence Sector. The focus is on total energy consumption, renewable energy adoption, machine uptime, facility performance, and fuel consumption trends from 2020 to 2024.📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)KPIValueDescriptionTotal Energy1.4 TWhThe current total energy measured/consumed.% Renewable45%The percentage of total energy derived from renewable sources.Machine Uptime96%The overall operational uptime of critical machinery.📈 Detailed Data Analysis1. Energy Consumption and MixThe data shows a consistent upward trend in overall energy consumption for the sector.Energy Consumption Trend (GWh):The line chart indicates a steady rise in consumption from approximately $0.4\text{ GWh}$ in 2020 to about $1.1\text{ GWh}$ in 2024.Energy Mix:The circular chart illustrates the composition of the current energy sources.Renewable: 45%Non-renewable: 40%Other: 15% (This value is inferred as the remaining percentage to make $100\%$ if the $40\%$ and $45\%$ values refer to the visible portions of the chart. However, based on the chart's visual segments and labels: Renewable is $45\%$, and Other is listed as $40\%$. The remaining $15\%$ is unlabelled.)Facilities Energy Split:A pie chart showing the energy usage breakdown by type within facilities:Renewable: 45%Non-renewable: 61%Other: (Not explicitly labelled, but the sum exceeds $100\%$. Interpretation: *Based on the visual representation, the labels might be misplaced or referencing different metrics. Assuming the $45\%$ and $61\%$ refer to two primary categories, the data is:**)Category 1 (Yellow/Non-renewable): 61%Category 2 (Blue/Renewable): 45%(Note: The sum is $106\%$, indicating a potential data or labelling anomaly in the source image.)2. Fuel Consumption (2020-2024)Fuel consumption has also shown an increasing trend over the years.YearFuel Consumption (Units: k)2020$\approx 100\text{k}$2021$\approx 150\text{k}$2022$\approx 200\text{k}$2023$\approx 220\text{k}$2024$\approx 250\text{k}$(Units are in thousands (k) as per the Y-axis label (300k, 200k, 100k).)3. Operational PerformanceOperational data provides insight into machine reliability and facility efficiency.Downtime Causes: This highlights the major reasons for the $4\%$ machine downtime.Maintenance: Highest cause (Length of bar $\approx 40\%$ of the maximum bar length)Technical: Second highest cause (Length of bar $\approx 35\%$)Operational: Lower cause (Length of bar $\approx 25\%$)Other: Lowest cause (Length of bar $\approx 20\%$)(The bars represent relative proportions, not absolute values, as percentages are not labelled.)Facility Performance: Measures the output or efficiency of key defence facilities.Facility A: Highest performanceFacility B: High performance (Slightly lower than A)Facility C: Moderate performanceFacility D: Lowest performance(Performance is relative, as absolute metrics are not labelled.)💾 Data SetBased on the dashboard visualization, the following tables represent the underlying data:Table 1: Primary KPIsMetricValueUnitTotal Energy1.4TWhRenewable Percentage45%Machine Uptime96%Table 2: Annual Energy and Fuel ConsumptionYearEnergy Consumption (GWh)Fuel Consumption (Units: k)2020$\approx 0.40$$\approx 100$2021$\approx 0.60$$\approx 150$2022$\approx 0.85$$\approx 200$2023$\approx 1.00$$\approx 220$2024$\approx 1.10$$\approx 250$Table 3: Energy Mix BreakdownEnergy SourcePercentage (%)Renewable45Non-renewable40 (Inferred)Other15 (Inferred)Table 4: Facilities Energy SplitEnergy TypePercentage (%)Renewable45Non-renewable61Table 5: Downtime Causes (Estimated Relative Proportions)CauseEstimated Relative WeightMaintenanceHighTechnicalMedium-HighOperationalMediumOtherLow💡 Conclusions and Next StepsThe Indian Defence Sector is making strides towards Strategic Energy Independence, with 45% of its total energy coming from renewable sources. However, the consistent increase in both Energy Consumption and Fuel Consumption from 2020 to 2024 suggests that while the transition is underway, the overall energy demand is rapidly growing.The high Machine Uptime (96%) is a positive indicator of operational efficiency, although a deeper focus on reducing Maintenance and Technical causes for the remaining downtime could improve performance further.
