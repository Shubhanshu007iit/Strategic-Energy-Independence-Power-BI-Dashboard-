# Strategic-Energy-Independence-Power-BI-Dashboard-
A Power BI-driven analytical dashboard that visualizes India’s journey toward strategic energy independence. This repository contains datasets, PBIX files, documentation, and insights related to energy production, import dependency, renewable growth, defense-sector energy usage, and policy impact evaluation.

## Project Overview
The dashboard visualizes total energy (1.4 TWh), renewable contribution (45%), machine uptime (96%), facility performance, downtime breakdown, energy mix, national facility map, and fuel consumption trends from 2020–2024. Data is modeled in CSV format and transformed using Power BI, Power Query, and DAX.

Conclusions

Energy demand and fuel dependency have grown over years; renewable adoption is improving but needs faster expansion. Maintenance downtime must be addressed. Facility-level improvements are recommended, especially for high-fuel and low-performance bases.
